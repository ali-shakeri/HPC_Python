# High Performance Computing in Python

## Part I: Introduction
  - Why Python is slower than C/C++?
  - Why should we use Python?
  - CPU-bounded vs memory-bounded problems
  - Profiling a Python code
  - Profiling memory usage
  - Some problems for benchmarking (Diffusion Eq., Numerical integration, ...)
  
## Part II: Data structures in Python
  - lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, ...
  - Iterators vs Generators
  - Matrix-vector operations
  - Efficient memory allocation
  - numpy and scipy
  - Excercise session

## Part III: Even faster? Compiling Python
  - Cython
  - Numba
  - PyPy
  - Parallelizing with OpenMP
  - Excercise session
  
## Part IV: Hands-on session
  - Apply what you learned on your code
